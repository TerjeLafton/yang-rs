# yang-rs
A collection of Rust libraries for working with YANG modules to manage network devices. This project is experimental and under active development.

## Overview
`yang-rs` aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools for network automation using YANG modeling language in Rust. It enables parsing YANG modules, generating Rust code from YANG models, and interfacing with network devices using gNMI.
Heavily inspired by the functionality provided by [`ygot`](https://github.com/openconfig/ygot) provides for Go.

## Current Status
| Crate | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `yang-parser` | Initial implementation underway - sufficient for development of other crates to begin |
| `yang-codegen` | Development just started |
| `yang-gnmi` | Not started |

## Crates

### `yang-parser`
The parser component converts YANG modules into Rust structs with resolved references. While primarily used by other crates in this repository, it's designed with a public API that allows others to build custom solutions on top of it.

The initial implementation takes a pragmatic approach, assuming YANG modules are well-formed. For more detailed information, please refer to the README in the `yang-parser` crate.

### `yang-codegen`
This crate transforms the Rust structs returned by `yang-parser` into Rust code representing the data nodes in the YANG schema. For example:
- Container nodes become Rust structs
- Leaf nodes become struct fields

The primary goal is to generate structs that integrate seamlessly with `yang-gnmi` for network device management.

### `yang-gnmi`
This crate provides the network interface functionality, allowing users to configure and subscribe to data on network devices. It leverages the structs generated by `yang-codegen` to create a type-safe experience, while focusing on providing:

- A client for connecting to network devices
- Utilities for creating and managing gNMI requests
- A clean API for device configuration and monitoring
